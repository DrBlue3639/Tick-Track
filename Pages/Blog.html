          Technology refers to tools, systems, and innovations developed by
          humans to solve problems, increase efficiency, and improve everyday
          life. It includes areas such as computers, smartphones, AI, and
          medicine. As a human tool, the watch began as a mechanical device for
          telling time and evolved into the digital watch and smartwatch. Today,
          they are both fashionable and functional, providing health tracking,
          communication, Internet access, and other functions, integrating
          technology into everyday life.

                System) which helps us to know about unknown places
              </li>
              <li>
                Also, smartwatches provide you the ability to call, message and
                get notifications which can be more portable than mobile phones
                and laptops
              </li>

              Watch market has grown and online platforms have helped its market
              grow making luxury watches accessible worldwide anytime you want.
              Technology has grown watch but also degraded in some factors it
              has caused old models, traditional crafts to diminish the
              appreciation towards them, and small brands have a lot of
              difficulties competing with the bigger companies.
              <br /><br />
              So we can say that although technology has made a big impact on
              today's world there are still some negative impacts of technology
              which are as follows:

              <li>
                Technology has grown watches but also degraded some factors
                causing old models, traditional crafts to lose appreciation
              </li>
              <li>
                Smaller brands have a lot of difficulties competing with bigger
                brands
              </li>
              <li>
                People switching to smartwatches has caused a loss of emotional
                and cultural values that ancient watches hold
              </li>
              <li>
                Smartwatches distract people resulting in reduced focus on the
                present moment
              </li>
              <li>
                Continuous use of smartwatches under low light can cause
                problems to our eyes
              </li>
              <li>
                Overdependence on devices impacts social interaction negatively
              </li>
              <li>
                Smartwatches can lead to over-reliance on technology for small
                tasks resulting in laziness
              </li>

            In conclusion, from traditional means to integrating the latest
            technology, the watch industry has greatly changed in its process of
            serving the preferences of consumers. The advent of smartwatches and
            advanced manufacturing methods expanded functionality and access,
            yet at the same time created a discussion of sustainability,
            cultural values, and even the possibility of counterfeiting.
            Embracing innovation yet preserving craftsmanship, offering
            personalization, and authenticity—the industry balances between
            heritage and progress in meaningful ways with customers across the
            globe.
